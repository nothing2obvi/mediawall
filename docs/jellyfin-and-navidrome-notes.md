## Jellyfin And Navidrome Notes

Jellyfin gives the best experience because MediaWall can access:

- Now Playing sessions
- user avatars
- movie, series, episode, and music metadata
- backdrops
- logos
- image tags for cache-busting changed artwork

Navidrome can be used for music playback. For artwork, MediaWall can use matching Jellyfin artist data when both services are configured, or local artist backdrop files when running Navidrome-only.

For Navidrome-only installations, enable:

```yaml
navidrome:
  artwork:
    local_files: true
```

Then add at least one `path_mappings` mapping whose `mediawall` value points to the local root containing artist folders:

```yaml
navidrome:
  artwork:
    path_mappings:
      - navidrome: "/music"
        mediawall: "/navidrome_music"
```

Older configs using `jellyfin` in a path mapping are still accepted for compatibility, but new configs should use `mediawall`.
